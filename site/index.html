        <h2>Divs vs Sections</h2>
       <div><p>This is a div. There are many like it but this one is mine. You can have disv within divs within divs within divs. Divs are the fundamental building blocks of sites. They don't need to share any theme besides anything attributed to an assigned ID or class. <p></div> 
    <section>This is a section. You can also have sections within sections within sections. Sections are thematic grouping of content. Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis.</section>

        <h2>Inline vs Block content</h2>
            Images are by default displayed inline with content. So this weird gif is actually displayed inline with the content of this paragraph.
            <img style="display:inline-block; width:200px; height:auto;" src="images/funny_gif.gif"> 
            See, I wrote right next to it and the bottom if it is inlined with the text.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Now some simple Javascript</h2>
    <div id="sayHi">
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Say Hi!</button>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="plugins/javascript.js"></script>
</body>
